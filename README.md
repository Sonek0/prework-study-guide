A study guide for course pre-work
## Description


My motivation was to learn a new skills to hopefully get a new job in the furture. Aside from being a homework project. This project was to help develop new skills and learn how web development works and cover the basics of Git, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Thus helping solve problems on how issues work on git hub and how a developer would take steps in solving a problem. I learned the basics of Git, how to push pull and open files through console commands through git bash. The basics of javascripts of learning string, array, console logs, and creating loops. I also learned how to create a CSS file and link the CSS file to a HTML file. HTML learned the structures of a webpage nad he how describe the body of an HTML document.
